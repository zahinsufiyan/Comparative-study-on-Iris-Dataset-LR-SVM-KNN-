# Iris Species Classification Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Iris Species Classification Project. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to classify iris species based on their physical attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 150 observations, each with four key features. These features are essential for predicting the iris type, thus defining our problem as a categorical classification task.

## Objective
Our aim is to develop, implement, and compare three different machine learning models to accurately classify iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Methodology
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: The project starts with the KNN algorithm to establish a baseline for the classification.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Next, we apply logistic regression to model the classification problem.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Lastly, we implement an SVM model for this task.

## Performance Evaluation
We will conduct a comparative study using classification reports and confusion matrices to evaluate and determine the most effective model among the three in classifying new iris species.

## Conclusion
This project aims not only to create accurate classification models but also to analyze and compare different machine learning approaches, helping us identify the most efficient method for iris species classification.
